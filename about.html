    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.15em; max-width: 800px; margin: 20px auto; line-height: 1.8;">
      In a world filled with complex apps and in-app purchases, we believe that creative play should be instant, intuitive, and safe. Creative Coloring was born from the simple idea that sparking a child's imagination with a color picker should be as easy as opening a browser.

  <h2>The Benefits of a Color Picker</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 40px; font-size: 1.1em;">
    Our color picker isn't just entertaining—it's also great for your child's development. Here's what regular use can help them achieve:
  </p>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Improved Fine Motor Skills</h3>
      <p>The simple act of tapping to color helps children practice hand-eye coordination and strengthens the small muscles in their hands, preparing them for writing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Enhanced Concentration</h3>
      <p>Focusing on a creative task like coloring helps improve a child's attention span and ability to concentrate, skills that are valuable in school and beyond.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Color & Shape Recognition</h3>
      <p>As they use the color picker, children naturally learn to identify and name different colors and shapes, building a fundamental vocabulary for art and the world around them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Creativity & Self-Expression</h3>
      <p>Coloring provides a safe outlet for children to express themselves. Choosing colors and completing a picture gives them a sense of accomplishment and boosts their confidence.</p>
